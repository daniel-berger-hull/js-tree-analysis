========

  Did merge the coding to have the line of the tree graph (done on Thursday) and the re centering of the canvas (Done on Friday)
  Some adjustement on the width of the tree been done, as it is sometime becoming too wide...

  To Do:
    Moving methods:

    Folling method should be done in the TreeGraph
        * Tree:: getChildLevel(level) *** Update: Removed April 22
        * find(value:int)       --> A node should only care about its value, and not try to search in its children    *** Update: Done April 22
          
        * getChildLevel(level)  --> It been commented out in Node, as it depends on the node.getDepth, which I removed     
                                    A better approach would be to have this method at the tree graph, give a node or value as       
                                    param, and the TreeGraph would did into the childre till it find or not the node/value
                                    If it does, then it should return the value (int) of the level where the node is
                                    i.e:  For a tree      a -->  b  -->   c  (It is more list here), 
                                          if we give 'c' , then it should return 3 (Third level)
